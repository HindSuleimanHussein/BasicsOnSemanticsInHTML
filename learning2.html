        <h1><mark>Why Pandas are Cute</mark></h1>
        <p>The giant panda is a bear species endemic to <mark>China.</mark>
            It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring
            musteloid.</p>

        <h4>Pandas are the Best</h4>
        <p>For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant
            panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with
            both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate
            the giant <mark>panda</mark> is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae.
            These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from the common ancestor of the Ursidae;
            it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species.
            The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.</p>
    </aside>


    <p>The word panda was borrowed into English from French,
        but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the
        French word panda has been found. The closest
        candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring
        to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to
        Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda.</p>
